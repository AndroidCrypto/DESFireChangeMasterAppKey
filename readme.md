# Mifare DESFire EV1/2/3 Examples (DES keys) using NFCjLib

This app is using the NFCjLib library from **Desfire Tools for Android** available on GitHub here:
https://github.com/skjolber/desfire-tools-for-android.

It was written by Thomas Skj√∏lberg ("skjolber") and this one is the best available source for accessing 
NXP's Mifare DESFire tags. 

If you are trying to get basic information's about the DESFire tag the first contact point is the  manufacturer's datasheet, available here:
- DESFire EV1 MF3ICDX21_41_81_SDS: https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/MF3ICDX21_41_81_SDS.pdf
- DESFire EV2 MF3DX2_MF3DHX2_SDS: https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/MF3DX2_MF3DHX2_SDS.pdf
- DESFire EV3 MF3D(H)x3: https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/MF3DHx3_SDS.pdf
- DESFire EV3 Quick start guide: https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/application-note/AN12753.pdf
- DESFire EV3 feature and functionality comparison to other MIFARE DESFire products: https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/application-note/AN12752.pdf

Unfortunately the 3 main datasheets are shortened by the manufacturer and the full datasheets are available under **Non disclosure agreements (NDA)** only - 
the agreement is not available for private persons.

So the only chance is to use the **datasheet for the first version of DESFire tags ("D40")** using this link:
https://neteril.org/files/M075031_desfire.pdf

Another fine piece of information is the **NXP MIFARE DESFire EV1 Protocol** available here: https://github.com/revk/DESFireAES/blob/master/DESFire.pdf. 
This is a short overview about most of the DESFire EV1 commands and error codes.
